Freeswitch Debian Installer
Author: Brian Foster (with help from the FreeSWITCH wiki and mailing lists)
This installer is known to work with Debian 6.0/Squeeze. It is not tested
for any other Debian version or Debian-based distro, although it could work...

Latest Stable: v1.0.4

At the end of this script, the outcome will be that:
- System environment is set up for FS use
- Proper user/group is created and permissions set properly for /usr/local/freeswitch/
- FS is installed properly (currently only git HEAD) <--Please open a issue on github if this
  is not what you want
- MOH and callie's prompts are installed (in every available format/bitrate/etc.)

This install script is ment for use by system integrators looking for a way to automate their
processes by giving them a template of how installs should be done. It can also be used by
our budding FS users to setup a FS environment recommended by the community as a whole.

Feedback is always appreciated. Please open an issue on github 
(http://github.com/bdfoster/fs-debian-installer/issues) if you find any bugs or if you have
an idea that would make this script more useful for you.
